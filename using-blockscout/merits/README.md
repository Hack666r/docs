# Merits

## What are Merits?

{% hint style="success" %}
To learn details about the program please see our dedicated [Merits announcement blog post](https://blog.blockscout.com/blockscout-merits-rewarding-block-explorer-skills).
{% endhint %}

* Merits are digital rewards that are collected by interacting with Blockscout and participating in various relevant activities.&#x20;
* Merits do not exist on any single blockchain, but rather are connected to an Externally Owned Account (`0x` address) via the Blockscout dashboard and your web3 wallet. &#x20;
* Merits can be earned on any chain where the program is supported, and Merits accumulate to an account across blockchains and rollups.&#x20;
* Merits are designed to make block exploration more fun and engaging, rewarding learning and regular usage.
* Merits do not have any material value, but in the future may unlock access to new features, merchandise, discounts, and other exclusive opportunities and benefits.
* You must login to Merits on Blockscout to see your balance and claim additional Merits.
* You can view more information about your Merits, the leaderboard and badges in the dedicated Merits hub at [https://merits.blockscout.com/](https://merits.blockscout.com/)

The following information relates to using the Blockscout Merits interface. See our [FAQs](faqs.md) for common questions.

## Sign up for Merits

Sign up to start collecting Merits and participating in the program. You will receive 100 Merits for signing up or 200 Merits if you use a referral link/code. There are several ways to signup:

* New account referral signup
* New account signup (no referral)
* Existing account signup

### New account referral signup

We recommend using a referral code to signup as you will receive an additional 100 Merits for a total of 200 Merits.  Ask a friend or Blockscout community member (telegram, discord)  if you need a code or link.

#### **1) Enter the link you received**&#x20;

The link will be the instance name followed by `/?ref=XXXXXX` for example [https://eth.blockscout.com/](https://eth.blockscout.com/)[?ref=9V4NUJ](https://eth.blockscout.com/?ref=9V4NUJ)\
\
&#xNAN;_&#x4E;ote: if you only have a code and not a link you will enter the code during step 5 of the sign in flow._ &#x20;

If starting with a referral link you will be forwarded to this page.
