{% endhint %}

Streaks provide an opportunity to earn additional Merits by visiting and claiming each day.&#x20;

* Every day in a row (0:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC)  you make a Merits claim, your streak increases by 1.&#x20;
* If you fail to make a claim within that window, your streak resets to 0.&#x20;
* Every 7 days of a streak results in an increased Merit reward. This is a single day award which can is claimed each 7th day of your streak (7,14,21,28 etc).&#x20;
* Currently, the highest reward is 20 Merits, for a total of 30 Merits (10 daily claim Merits + 20 streak reward Merits) claimed on streak reward days.
